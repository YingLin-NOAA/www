Currently the above server is only accessible from within the NCED firewall.

Both databases are now loaded daily by an unattended cron job.  mv_ylin_pcp is loaded for daym9 and includes 6h FSS.  mv_ylin_pcp_erly is loaded for daym2 and does not include 6h FSS. <P>

<P>
Due to disk space limitations on the METviewer server, the databases are often pruned.  Currently only a small subset of precip VSDBs have been loaded. 
<P>
 Contact Ying[dot]Lin[at]noaa[dot]gov if you'd like other precip VSDBs loaded into either database.
